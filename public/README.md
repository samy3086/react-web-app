data.js:
This file contains a list of all the products used in the shop. Each product has some information like id(1,2,3...), title (the name), image (a link to the product photo), price, category (Man or Women), how many times it was viewed (views), how many were sold (sold), and one or more reviews (comments and ratings from users). This is just a simple way to store data so it can be shown on the website â€” like in the homepage or the product list.in 
Navbar.jsx:
It is a file creates the top menu of the website. It lets users click on categories like "Home", "Man", or "Women" to filter products, search for items using a search bar, and open the shopping cart to see how many items are inside. When the user clicks on the "HS-Shop" logo, it resets the filters and shows all products. The file uses small functions to do this: (handleSearch) handles the search bar and sends the search text to the main page, (handleCategoryClick) changes the product category when a button is clicked, and the logo also resets everything. The design uses Bootstrap to make the menu look clean and organized, react-router-dom for page navigation, and react-icons to show the cart icon.
Home.jsx:
This file creates the main shop page, displaying products in cards with images, titles, and prices. Users can filter products by category (like "Man" or "Women") and search for specific items by name. They can add products to the cart by clicking the "Ajouter au panier" button and view product details by clicking "Voir le produit" to go to the individual product page. The page uses useState() to manage the product list and filters the products based on the category and search term. When a user clicks the Add to Cart button, it uses the addtoCart() function from cartcontext to add the item to the cart. The layout is designed with Bootstrap classes, making the page clean and responsive. The file imports React and the useState hook for managing the state of the component, Link from react-router-dom for navigation between pages, the products array from data/data to display the product information, and useCart from cartcontext to handle adding items to the cart.
